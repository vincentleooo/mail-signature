# Mail Signature

This is just a simple template for my mail signature. Email clients are surprisingly ancient in its support for HTML features, hence the general advice to use tables instead. It is a bit janky, but it works for now.

Credits for the logo images go to FontAwesome and [this](https://fa2png.app) tool that converts it into PNG files.

SVG does not work, and for the smaller logos, I embedded it as a Base64 data within. You can convert these using various tools. I used [this](https://www.opinionatedgeek.com/Codecs/Base64Encoder).
